    <h1>Best places to choose from</h1>
    <hr>

    <div class="restaurant">
      <h2>1. Shirley's</h2>
      <p><strong>Location:</strong> Chalan Kanoa, Saipan</p>
      <img src="" alt="Shirley's">
      <p>Shirley's is an all time favorite just due to the portions and having my favorite menu item being the Ham and Cheese Omlette. This with their fried rice is honestly the best in my opinion. Though out the years their quality never dimished and continues to be an all time comfort spot.</p>
      <h4>What I love:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Ham and cheese Omlette</li>
        <li>Not too expensive</li>
        <li>Big portions</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="restaurant">
      <h2>2. Tang Ji</h2>
     <p><strong>Location:</strong> Pali Arnold, Saipan</p>
      <img src="" alt="Tang Ji">
      <p>Tang Ji was a restaurant that many don't know about and due to their location it seems suspicious but rest assured this place has the best mapo tofu in my opinion. Their style and location really feels like a random joint that feeds you well and only cares about how the food makes you feel.</p>
       <h4>What I love:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Mapo Tofu</li>
        <li>not long wait times</li>
        <li>Big portions</li>
        <li>Extemely Cheap</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="restaurant">
      <h2>3. Mango Six</h2>
      <p><strong>Location:</strong> Dandan, Saipan</p>
       <img src="" alt="Mango Six">
      <p>Mango six is a comfort spot that has amazing drinks and great food to come with. It sure is on the pricey sides for portions but it is worth it due to flavor profiles and how much it makes you want to continue ordering more.</p>
      <h4>What I love:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Bulgogi Burger</li>
        <li>Comforting vibes</li>
        <li>Great drinks</li>
        <li>location is great</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="restaurant">
      <h2>4. Paris Crossant</h2>
      <p><strong>Location:</strong> Garapan, Saipan</p>
       <img src="" alt="Paris Crossant">
      <p>Paris Crossant was an all time favorite due to their spicy and sweet teokk that would have me wanting to get more. Their vibe is emaculate and is overall a great place if you want to rest and enjoy the city.</p>
      <h4>What I love:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Greatest Teokk</li>
        <li>The location is in the center</li>
        <li>Amazing vibe with full windows</li>
        <li>Cozy interier</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="restaurant">
      <h2>5. Js Restaurant</h2>
       <p><strong>Location:</strong> Garapan, Saipan</p>
       <img src="" alt="Paris Crossant">
      <p>Js is an all time place for families just due how it is the default family restaurant and has many memories that grew with the island. Their games were a staple of the past and till now the nostilga still hits in ways that makes you remenise of your childhood. Their food is also great and the ham and cheese omlette is just as good as Shirley's.</p>
      <h4>What I love:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Family Restaurant</li>
        <li>Good food with familiar vibes</li>
        <li>the games are still a fun past time</li>
        <li>Cozy chairs feels good</li>
      </ul>
